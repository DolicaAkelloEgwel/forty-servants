Are you having the same conversations with the same people about the same topics? Do you long for excitement and adventure and a release from the boring prison of mundane life?

- name: The Conductor
  short_desc: This Servant shows us how to take control of our life circumstances. He encourages us to take a more active role in orchestrating and arranging the events of our lives.
  long_desc: The Conductor is the magician of the orchestra, using his wand to control the music and rhythm to his preference.  He is all about taking control and being in charge of the world around you. Are you the conductor leading the orchestra, or are you one of the minor players? Are you being swayed in time with the music being played, or are you marching to the beat of your own drum? This Servant suggests that you look at the circumstances of your life and see what roles you are actually playing. Are you merely reacting to life and accepting all that comes your way, or are you taking the lead role and living your life the way you want? Are you in flow with the music and rhythm of life and the world, or are you out of step with the beat? Is the soundtrack to your life an upbeat triumphant chorus of angels or a lonely solo violin weeping mournfully in the rain? The Conductor calls to you to take more control over your life and to direct the music of this existence to what you want rather than just marching along to the beat of others. While you may never be fully in control of every event that occurs to or around you, you can compose your own life soundtrack to be more individual, beautiful and inspiring. The Conductor can help you take control of events, relationships, jobs, circumstances, or anything surrounding you and put your own stamp on it. The Conductor can show you how to move and manipulate the events of your life so that they become more harmonious and pleasing to you.

- name: The Contemplator
  short_desc: This Servant shows us how to access our subconscious mind. He encourages us to temporarily let go of thinking about our problems so that the subconscious mind can find a solution.
  long_desc: The Contemplator suggests that the best course of action is to pull back and withdraw from thinking about your current issue for a while. Some problems are best solved by taking a break from thinking about them altogether or sleeping overnight on them. It’s usually when we relax that the solution appears. The Contemplator suggests that you turn your concern over to your subconscious mind to solve for you. Let the quandary fall to the back of your mind, and thus allowing the subconscious to find a resolution. This Servant can also suggest that something is buried deep within your subconscious mind and that you need to become aware of it. It could be an old idea, a limiting belief, or a bad past experience, but whatever it is, it is tainting your judgement of your current predicament. The Contemplator has access to all the information in your subconscious mind. He is aware of all your inner workings, motivations, beliefs and long-forgotten memories. He knows the underlying reasons why you act or don’t act. He knows everything you have done that you weren’t paying attention to. He knows more about you than you do. And you can ask him to supply you with any of this information. Any problem can be handed over to The Contemplator for deep processing and a solution found. Visualise yourself psychically handing the issue over to The Contemplator, then try as much as possible to put it out of your mind altogether. Within the next few hours, or maybe days, the solution will suddenly appear fully formed in your mind. The Contemplator can be asked to reveal a solution to any problem at hand. Give as complete an explanation as possible regarding the nature of the problem and any pertinent information to The Contemplator. This should be spoken out loud. In another very humble but highly effective role, The Contemplator can help you remember details that are temporarily forgotten, such as phone numbers, people’s names, or where you left your keys. Take a brief moment and mentally give the problem to The Contemplator and wait for the reply. It shouldn’t be forced or pressured. The Contemplator is also useful for transferring new skills or information into our long-term subconscious minds for later retrieval or automation. Great for forming new habits or breaking old ones.
- name: The Dancer

  long_desc: When this Servant appears, it signals that sometimes the best thing you can do when it rains is to dance in it. Life can be challenging, and sometimes things just don’t go the way we want them to no matter how hard we try. It is an inevitable part of life that sometimes we just lose despite our most exemplary efforts. And that’s ok. The Dancer, however, is here to remind you that it’s not ok to just give up. The Dancer suggests that rather than spiralling into depression or becoming disheartened, you should rejoice in the effort made and dance in the rain. Life may be falling apart around you, but The Dancer reminds you that you are entirely in control of your reactions towards it. You can choose to fall apart, or you can choose to laugh along with it. The Dancer reminds you that even a failure can be celebrated as it brings the lessons that will get you closer to your goals. When life is tough, the Dancer calls out to take things less seriously and just enjoy the moment, no matter what that moment is. Ask The Dancer to help you stay afloat when times are tough or when your plans have failed. Invoke The Dancer when you need to pick yourself up and get back into the game. Ask The Dancer to help you see the good even in the darkest moments or to show you the prettiness of the rain and the joy of the dance. Let The Dancer show you how to never give up.

She reminds you that there is a vast amount of wisdom available to you from the experiences of the world’s entire population, including all who have long since died. The Dead asks you to reflect on your past experiences so that you don’t make the same mistakes again. For instance, are you making the same mistakes in this relationship as your previous ones? Are you ignoring the experiences of those who have gone before you and think that you know better? Are you dismissing an old-fashioned idea or method simply because it is old? Are you ignoring messages and teachings of deceased friends, relatives or people of note? The Dead can be used for general ancestor work. An offering to The Dead is an offering to your ancestors and the Mighty Dead, and you should thank them for all they have done. Remember, you would not exist if it weren’t for all those who came before you. If someone close to you passes, you can ask The Dead to help bring them safely to the other side and look after them as they make their way into the next stage of their existence.
